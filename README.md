&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NER (Named-Entity Recognition) is used to categorize entitiy from a text. Sometimes this is used to resume parser, medical parser, receipt parser and so on. In this case I will used NER to recognize entity from a medical report. For the data I downloaded from [Kaggle - MEDICAL NER](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finalepoch/medical-ner)
